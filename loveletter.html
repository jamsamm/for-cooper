                        <li>The way you love me and how your presence makes every moment better</li>
                        <li>Your laugh and the way you make me laugh</li>
                        <li>The way you talk about the things you love. I could listen to you all day</li>
                        <li>Every single thing about you. You're so perfect in my eyes</li>

                    <p>I love you more than I thought I could ever love anyone. I love you on the good days, when everything feels like it's going just right. I love you on the hard days when nothing seems to work. I love you always.</p>
                    
                    <p>You are my person, and I'm so happy to have you in my life. You are the best thing to ever happen to me.</p>
