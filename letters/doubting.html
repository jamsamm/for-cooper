                    <p>To my most favourite person in the world,</p>
                    
                    <p>This letter is for when you're doubting yourself or feeling like you're just not good enough. I want you to know that you are more than good enough. Even at your worst, you are still the best and you are worth it and so loved.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some of the reasons why I believe in you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You care. About others, about doing the right thing and about being better.</li>
                        <li>You're so strong. Stronger than you think. You've overcome so much.</li>
                        <li>Your're so super duper smart. It amazes me every day.</li>
                        <li>You make me so proud every single day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If you ever doubt yourself, the doubts your feeling are not facts. They're just your fears talking. And fears are big fat liars.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe in you and I'm so proud of you.</p>
