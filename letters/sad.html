                    <p>Hi babylicious,</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're reading this, I'm really sorry that you're feeling sad right now.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whatever you are feeling right now is valid and you're never alone. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone or hide your emotions - everyone gets a little sad sometimes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please remember:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are sosososo loved. By me, always. On the good days and the bad</li>
                        <li>What you're feeling right now will pass. It'll all be okay</li>
                        <li>It's okay to ask for help. Whether you need to talk, or just sit in silence, I'm here for you</li>
                        <li>You deserve all the happiness in the world</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Take a deep breath🧘 If you need me, I'm here - just a call or message away.</p>
                    
                    <p>I love you soosososoooo much.</p>
