                    <p>Hi baby,</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm sorry if we're arguing right now. If you're hurting, that matters to me more than being right.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't know what we're fighting about, but just know: I love you. Even when I'm angry or upset. I love you always. And nothing could ever change that.</p>
                    
                    <p>Remember that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We're on the same team</li>
                        <li>We can disagree and still love each other</li>
                        <li>Communication is important</li>
                        <li>We'll work this out, like we always do</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I want you to feel like you can always talk to me. And I want to understand you better.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm sorry, and I'm always here to listen.</p>
